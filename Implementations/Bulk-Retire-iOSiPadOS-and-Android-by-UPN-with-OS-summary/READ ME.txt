There are instructions in the “Run it” text document. The PowerShell script runs through MSGraph and bulk retires iOS, iPadOS, and Android Intune managed mobile devices based on a list of UPNs listed in the upns .csv file. It supports a Dry Run mode which only previews the results, separates iOS and Android for reporting, and generates two reports for a detailed view and summary view. This is great for speeding up MAM deployments if your moving off of MDM since a .csv upload is not supported for retiring devices within the Intune portal.
